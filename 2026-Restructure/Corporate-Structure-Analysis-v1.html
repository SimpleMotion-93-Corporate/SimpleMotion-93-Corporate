<h1>2. Sole Trader</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A sole trader is the simplest business structure where an individual operates a business in their own name or a registered business name.</p>

<h2>Advantages</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Minimal setup and ongoing compliance requirements</li>
    <li><strong>Control:</strong> Complete decision-making authority</li>
    <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Lowest establishment and maintenance costs</li>
    <li><strong>Tax losses:</strong> Business losses offset personal income</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Limited public disclosure requirements</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Unlimited liability:</strong> Personal assets at risk for business debts</li>
    <li><strong>Tax rates:</strong> Subject to personal marginal tax rates (up to 45% + Medicare levy)</li>
    <li><strong>Growth limitations:</strong> Difficult to raise capital or bring in partners</li>
    <li><strong>Continuity:</strong> Business ceases on death or incapacity</li>
    <li><strong>Perception:</strong> May be perceived as less established</li>
</ul>

<h2>Suitability for SimpleMotion</h2>
<div class="not-recommended">
<p><strong>Not recommended</strong> as the primary structure. SimpleMotion's engineering services carry professional liability risks that make unlimited personal liability unacceptable. However, a sole trader ABN may be useful for minor consulting activities.</p>
</div>

<!-- Section 3 -->
<h1>3. Partnership</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A partnership involves two or more persons carrying on a business together with a view to profit. Governed by state Partnership Acts and typically a partnership agreement.</p>

<h2>Types</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>General Partnership:</strong> All partners share management and liability</li>
    <li><strong>Limited Partnership:</strong> Limited partners contribute capital but don't manage; at least one general partner with unlimited liability</li>
</ul>

<h2>Advantages</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Profit sharing can be structured as agreed</li>
    <li><strong>Combined resources:</strong> Pool skills, capital, and networks</li>
    <li><strong>Tax treatment:</strong> No entity-level tax; profits flow to partners</li>
    <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Easier to establish than a company</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Joint and several liability:</strong> Each partner liable for all partnership debts</li>
    <li><strong>Disputes:</strong> Partner disagreements can paralyse operations</li>
    <li><strong>Continuity:</strong> Partnership may dissolve on partner death/departure</li>
    <li><strong>Limited capital raising:</strong> Cannot issue shares</li>
</ul>

<h2>Suitability for SimpleMotion</h2>
<div class="not-recommended">
<p><strong>Not recommended</strong> as the primary structure. The joint and several liability exposure is problematic for engineering services. Partnership may be useful for specific joint ventures with other firms.</p>
</div>

<!-- Section 4 -->
<h1>4. Trusts</h1>

<h2>4.1 Discretionary Trust (Family Trust)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A discretionary trust holds assets for the benefit of beneficiaries, with the trustee having discretion over income and capital distributions. Commonly used for family wealth management and small business operations.</p>

<h3>Key Components</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Settlor:</strong> Establishes the trust (usually with nominal settlement sum)</li>
    <li><strong>Trustee:</strong> Manages trust assets and makes distributions (individual or corporate)</li>
    <li><strong>Beneficiaries:</strong> Those who may receive distributions</li>
    <li><strong>Trust Deed:</strong> Governs trust operation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Tax flexibility:</strong> Distribute income to beneficiaries in lower tax brackets</li>
    <li><strong>Asset protection:</strong> Trust assets generally protected from beneficiary creditors</li>
    <li><strong>Estate planning:</strong> Facilitates intergenerational wealth transfer</li>
    <li><strong>CGT concessions:</strong> Access to 50% CGT discount</li>
    <li><strong>Income splitting:</strong> Distribute to family members (subject to rules)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Requires proper establishment and ongoing administration</li>
    <li><strong>Costs:</strong> Setup ($1,500-$3,000) and annual compliance costs</li>
    <li><strong>Loss quarantining:</strong> Trust losses cannot be distributed; carried forward in trust</li>
    <li><strong>Land tax:</strong> May face surcharges in some states</li>
    <li><strong>Trustee liability:</strong> Trustee personally liable unless corporate trustee used</li>
</ul>

<h2>4.2 Unit Trust</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A unit trust divides beneficial ownership into fixed units, similar to shares. Unit holders have fixed entitlements based on units held.</p>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Defined interests:</strong> Clear ownership proportions</li>
    <li><strong>Transferability:</strong> Units can be bought and sold</li>
    <li><strong>External investors:</strong> Suitable for unrelated parties investing together</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>No distribution flexibility:</strong> Must distribute according to unit holdings</li>
    <li><strong>Limited tax planning:</strong> Cannot stream income to lower-taxed beneficiaries</li>
    <li><strong>CGT on unit transfer:</strong> Disposal of units triggers CGT</li>
</ul>

<h3>Suitability for SimpleMotion</h3>
<div class="recommendation">
<p><strong>Discretionary trust recommended</strong> as part of a broader structure. A family trust with a corporate trustee provides:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Income distribution flexibility for tax efficiency</li>
    <li>Asset protection for accumulated wealth</li>
    <li>Estate planning benefits</li>
    <li>Shield for investment assets separate from trading operations</li>
