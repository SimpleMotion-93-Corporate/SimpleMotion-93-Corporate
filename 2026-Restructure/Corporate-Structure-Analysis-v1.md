## 2. Sole Trader

### Description

A sole trader is the simplest business structure where an individual operates a business in their own name or a registered business name.

### Advantages

- **Simplicity**: Minimal setup and ongoing compliance requirements
- **Control**: Complete decision-making authority
- **Cost**: Lowest establishment and maintenance costs
- **Tax losses**: Business losses offset personal income
- **Privacy**: Limited public disclosure requirements

### Disadvantages

- **Unlimited liability**: Personal assets at risk for business debts
- **Tax rates**: Subject to personal marginal tax rates (up to 45% + Medicare levy)
- **Growth limitations**: Difficult to raise capital or bring in partners
- **Continuity**: Business ceases on death or incapacity
- **Perception**: May be perceived as less established

### Suitability for SimpleMotion

**Not recommended** as the primary structure. SimpleMotion's engineering services carry professional liability risks that make unlimited personal liability unacceptable. However, a sole trader ABN may be useful for minor consulting activities.

---

## 3. Partnership

### Description

A partnership involves two or more persons carrying on a business together with a view to profit. Governed by state Partnership Acts and typically a partnership agreement.

### Types

- **General Partnership**: All partners share management and liability
- **Limited Partnership**: Limited partners contribute capital but don't manage; at least one general partner with unlimited liability

### Advantages

- **Flexibility**: Profit sharing can be structured as agreed
- **Combined resources**: Pool skills, capital, and networks
- **Tax treatment**: No entity-level tax; profits flow to partners
- **Simplicity**: Easier to establish than a company

### Disadvantages

- **Joint and several liability**: Each partner liable for all partnership debts
- **Disputes**: Partner disagreements can paralyse operations
- **Continuity**: Partnership may dissolve on partner death/departure
- **Limited capital raising**: Cannot issue shares

### Suitability for SimpleMotion

**Not recommended** as the primary structure. The joint and several liability exposure is problematic for engineering services. Partnership may be useful for specific joint ventures with other firms.

## 4. Trusts

### 4.1 Discretionary Trust (Family Trust)

### Description

A discretionary trust holds assets for the benefit of beneficiaries, with the trustee having discretion over income and capital distributions. Commonly used for family wealth management and small business operations.

### Key Components

- **Settlor**: Establishes the trust (usually with nominal settlement sum)
- **Trustee**: Manages trust assets and makes distributions (individual or corporate)
- **Beneficiaries**: Those who may receive distributions
- **Trust Deed**: Governs trust operation

### Advantages

- **Tax flexibility**: Distribute income to beneficiaries in lower tax brackets
- **Asset protection**: Trust assets generally protected from beneficiary creditors
- **Estate planning**: Facilitates intergenerational wealth transfer
- **CGT concessions**: Access to 50% CGT discount
- **Income splitting**: Distribute to family members (subject to rules)

### Disadvantages

- **Complexity**: Requires proper establishment and ongoing administration
- **Costs**: Setup ($1,500-$3,000) and annual compliance costs
- **Loss quarantining**: Trust losses cannot be distributed; carried forward in trust
- **Land tax**: May face surcharges in some states
- **Trustee liability**: Trustee personally liable unless corporate trustee used

### 4.2 Unit Trust

### Description

A unit trust divides beneficial ownership into fixed units, similar to shares. Unit holders have fixed entitlements based on units held.

### Advantages

- **Defined interests**: Clear ownership proportions
- **Transferability**: Units can be bought and sold
- **External investors**: Suitable for unrelated parties investing together

### Disadvantages

- **No distribution flexibility**: Must distribute according to unit holdings
- **Limited tax planning**: Cannot stream income to lower-taxed beneficiaries
- **CGT on unit transfer**: Disposal of units triggers CGT

### Suitability for SimpleMotion

**Discretionary trust recommended** as part of a broader structure. A family trust with a corporate trustee provides:
- Income distribution flexibility for tax efficiency
- Asset protection for accumulated wealth
- Estate planning benefits
- Shield for investment assets separate from trading operations

---

## 5. Proprietary Limited Company (Pty Ltd)

### Description

A Pty Ltd company is a separate legal entity limited by shares, with shareholders' liability limited to unpaid share amounts. The most common structure for Australian small-to-medium businesses.

### Types

- **Small Proprietary Company**: Revenue < $50M, assets < $25M, employees < 100
- **Large Proprietary Company**: Exceeds two of the above thresholds

### Advantages

- **Limited liability**: Shareholders not personally liable for company debts
- **Separate legal entity**: Can own property, sue and be sued
- **Perpetual existence**: Continues despite shareholder changes
- **Tax rate**: Base rate of 25% for eligible small businesses (2026)
- **Professional image**: Often perceived as more established
- **Capital raising**: Can issue shares to raise capital
- **Employee incentives**: Can offer share-based compensation

### Disadvantages

- **Compliance**: Annual reviews, ASIC fees, director duties
- **Costs**: Higher establishment and ongoing costs
- **Profit extraction**: Dividends subject to personal tax; division 7A applies to loans
- **Director liability**: Directors can be personally liable in certain circumstances
- **Loss access**: Company losses trapped in company

### Director Duties (Corporations Act 2001)

- Act in good faith in the best interests of the company
- Act for a proper purpose
- Not improperly use position or information
- Prevent insolvent trading
- Disclose material personal interests

### Suitability for SimpleMotion

**Highly recommended** as the primary trading entity. A Pty Ltd company provides:
- Professional liability protection essential for engineering services
- Established structure for client contracts
- Clear framework for potential future partners or employees
- Access to small business tax rate (25%)
- Base rate entity eligibility if passive income < 80%

---

## 6. Public Company

### Description

A public company can offer shares to the public and may be listed on a stock exchange. Subject to extensive regulatory requirements.

### Suitability for SimpleMotion

**Not recommended** at current scale. The compliance burden and costs are disproportionate to SimpleMotion's current operations. May become relevant if significant external capital raising is required in future.

---

## 7. Recommended Structure for SimpleMotion

### Proposed Structure: Trust + Corporate Trustee + Trading Company

## 10. Asset Protection Analysis

### Risk Profile

| Risk Category | Exposure | Mitigation |
|---------------|----------|------------|
| Professional liability | High | PI insurance; company structure |
| Contract disputes | Medium | Company structure; clear terms |
| Employee claims | Medium | Workers comp; company structure |
| Personal guarantees | Variable | Minimise; negotiate limits |
| Director liability | Low-Medium | D&O insurance; compliance |

### Protection Mechanisms

1. **Corporate trading entity**: Primary protection; debts generally limited to company assets
2. **Trust ownership**: Shares held by trust, not personally; trust assets protected
3. **Insurance**: Professional indemnity, public liability, D&O coverage
4. **Contract terms**: Limitation of liability clauses; clear scope definitions
5. **Separate asset classes**: Investment assets in different entity from trading

### Limitations
